# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using CNN & Time Series  

## 🌟 Overview  
This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Time Series Analysis** to predict stock prices over time. The model takes historical stock data, processes it using deep learning, and forecasts future stock prices.

## 📂 Project Structure  
This repository contains a single Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file that performs the entire workflow, including:  
✔ Data Collection  
✔ Data Preprocessing  
✔ Feature Engineering  
✔ CNN Model Training  
✔ Stock Price Prediction  
✔ Performance Evaluation  

## 🔧 Requirements  
Before running the notebook, install the necessary dependencies:  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow keras scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RakeshPathlavath07/Stock_pred_app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   ```bash
   cd Stock_pred_app
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run all the cells to train and evaluate the model.

## 📊 Results  
- The model predicts stock prices using historical data.  
- The evaluation metrics include **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** and **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**.  

## 📌 Future Improvements  
- Implement **LSTM** or hybrid CNN-LSTM models for better accuracy.  
- Use external financial indicators like **RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands**.  
- Deploy as a web app using **Flask or Streamlit**.
